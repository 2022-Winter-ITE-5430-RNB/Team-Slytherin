      <h1> Important Steps that helps in raising a Pet</h1>
      <h3>It is important to know how the animal will react at home, on the street
         and even with other people, we must also know what to do about it. Always with 
         patience and lots of affection.</h3>
        <h2>Life Balance</h2>
      <p>Your pet is part of your family it's important to manage your time properly.
       We are all pretty busy especially if we are parents shuttling our children
        around to their various sports and hobbies. Juggling that with work and a
         pet, it is essential you schedule time in your calendar for you, your pet,
          and your family.

      <h2>Set Limits</h2>
      <p>Just like children, dogs thrive on rules and structure.  Your dog should have 
        a clear and consistent set of rules that everyone in the house follows with the 
        dog. 
        <br />
        My favorite is wait at the door.  Teach your dog he may not run through doors 
        to the outside without your permission.  Make sure everyone in the house follows 
        this rule - Always! Keep in mind, dogs are very bad at generalizing.  This means 
        that you should not let your dog jump on you when wearing workout clothes, but yell 
        at him when he jumps on your work clothes. This will only confuse or frustrate your 
        dog and cause naughty behavior.</p>
      <h2>Responsibilty</h2>
      <p>Responsibility goes both ways.  It is up to you to learn how to positively train 
        your dog so he understands what you want.  Often dogs misbehave because training has 
        not been practiced enough, the instructions were not clear, or you expected too much 
        out of the dog too soon.  Rewards such as treats and play are used as communication 
        with the dog throughout the learning process.  Since your dog cannot ask you questions, 
        he must learn through trial and error.  There will be a lot of rewards given in the 
        beginning.  Then it is your dog's responsibility to learn that he does not get a reward 
        for every single cue (command) given. Once your dog can follow a cue successfully at 
        least 80% of the time, start fading out the rewards.
